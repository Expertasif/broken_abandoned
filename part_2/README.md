##Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code, Part 2

This code corresponds with [part 2](http://shadow-file.blogspot.com) of the Broken, Abandoned, and Forgotten Code series. In that part, I finish describing how to play the right timing games to get the UPnP daemon to accept your request for the "SetFirmware" hidden SOAP action. I also make a guess at what the HTTP headers might look like for that request. The code in this directory exercises those code paths in upnpd.
